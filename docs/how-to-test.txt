How to test Dicfro
------------------

Requirements:
- install Pear and PHPUnit, see "how-to-install-pear.txt" or "sudo apt install phpunit" on debian
- add the path to PHPUnit in the include path, eg "/usr/share/php" on debian


1. Test suite
-------------
- open a command line or shell prompt
- go to the "tests" directory
- run "runtest -a"

Note: other options are available, run "runtest -h" to list all the options.


2. Test debugging
-----------------
- add the paths to "dicfro/application" and to "dicfro/tests" in the include path
- select the test file
- debug as PHPUnit test


3. Test coverage
----------------
- install the xdebug extension from http://xdebug.org/wizard.php and follow the instructions
- run "runtest -c"
- load "file:///.../dicfro/public/documentation/phpunit/coverage/index.html" in your web browser

Notes:

If you have another debugger setup in you php.ini file or if you do not wish to change it,
simply download the xdebug extension into the PHP extensions directory.
The test coverage should run just fine.

You may also want to adjust the following constants:
- Test::PHP_EXTENSION_DIR to override the automatic detection the PHP extension directory
- Test::PHP_INI_FILE      to override the automatic detection of the PHP ini file
- Test::PHP_PEAR_BIN_DIR  to override the automatic detection of the Pear binary directory
- Test::XDEBUG_EXTENSION  to override the automatic detection of the Xdebug extension
