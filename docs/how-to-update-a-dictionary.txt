How to update a dictionary
--------------------------

This applies to dictionaries dowloaded from Hruodlandus et Alda, http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~ogurisu/Fr/Intro.html.
The procedure is described for each dictionary in its change log file, eg application/data/chretien/changelog.txt.


As an example
-------------
- download FoersterEdic.zip from http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~ogurisu/Fr/Foerster.html in sources/chretien/v2,
  the sub directory v2 has a download instance number, the second downloaded "version" in this example
- unzip FoersterEdic.zip
- update chretien/changes/config.php to compare the txt file and the images files between the version just downloaded and the previous one
- run "find-changes chretien" to compare both version,
  this will calculate the hash of the new files, and compare them to the hash of the files in the previous version
- review and process the result
- remove the unzipped files from sources/chretien/v2
- keep the zipped file for reference, note that sources files are not stored in SVN
