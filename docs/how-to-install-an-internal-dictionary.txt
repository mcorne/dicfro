How to install an internal dictionary
-------------------------------------


1. Install an internal dictionary
---------------------------------

This applies to internal dictionaries dowloaded from Hruodlandus et Alda, http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~ogurisu/Fr/Intro.html.
The procedure is described for each dictionary in the first entry of its change log file, eg application/data/lacurne/changelog.txt.

As an example (excerpts)
-------------
- download LacEdic.zip from http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~ogurisu/Fr/Lac.html in sources/lacurne,
  the sub directory v1 has a download instance number, the initial downloaded "version" in this case
- unzip LacEdic.zip
- run irfanview: batch conversion - renamed result files etc...
- add "lacurne" entry in config.php, in both dictionaries and groups
- run "parse lacurne", fix parser and txt as needed
- add picture
    * resize to 200px max
    * save into dicfro/public/img/pages/dictionnaire-lacurne.jpg
    * update docs/images-source.txt
- add intro in application/View/scripts/introduction/lacurne.phtml
- initialize lacurne/changes/config.php
- run "init-changes lacurne" to create txt and img hashes
  this will calculate the hash of the sources files, for comparison with subsquent versions
- remove the unzipped files from sources/lacurne/v1
- keep the zipped file for reference, note that sources files are not stored in SVN
