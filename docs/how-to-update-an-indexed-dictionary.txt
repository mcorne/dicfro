How to update an indexed dictionary
-----------------------------------


This applies to indexed dictionaries such as the Larousse dictionaries and the Century dictionary.
The procedure is described for each dictionary in its change log file, eg application/data/century/changelog.txt.

Note that some dictionaries have files with fixes used by the entries extractor.
Their formats are described in the dictionary fix-examples directory, eg application/data/encyclopedie-larousse/fix-examples.


As an exemple
-------------
- open application/data/grand-larousse/index.csv
- change the entry, eg replace empty entry with "zygote" for page 6528
- run "parse grand-larousse" to update the database
- add a log entry in application/data/grand-larousse/changelog.txt
