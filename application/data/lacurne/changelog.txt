version v1
----------
- 24/3/2013
- downloaded http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~ogurisu/Fr/Lac.html in sources/lacurne
- unzipped LacEdic.zip

- ran irfanview:
    * batch conversion - renamed result files
    * output = gif
    * bulk resize = 50%
    * name pattern = 0100###
    * output directory = dicfro/public/dictionary/lacurne/mImg
    * input directory = sources/lacurne/v1/LacEdic/mImg
    * select 01-*, sort by name, add
    * start batch
- repeat the process for 02, 03 etc...
- repeat the process for ex/0, pattern = 01_page_###, start at page 1, renamed japonese for page in file name
- repeat the process for ex/11, pattern = $N, 
  should ideally start at page 203 with 1010### to be used as separate dictionary (curiositÃ©s) but there are page numbering issues

- added "lacurne" entry in config.php, in both dictionaries and groups
- ran "parse lacurne", fixed parser
- fixed txt: note that the order order is not important as it is resorted by parser
    * changed "aparition__BR____BR__image=><@_02-044.tiff_>LacEdic__BR____BR__"
    * to      "apparition__BR____BR__image=><@_02-044.tiff_>LacEdic__BR____BR__"

- added picture
    * resized to 200px max
    * saved into dicfro/public/img/pages/dictionnaire-lacurne.jpg
    * updated docs/images-source.txt

- added intro in application/View/scripts/introduction/lacurne.phtml

- initialized lacurne/changes/config.php
- ran "init-changes lacurne" to create txt and img hashes
