- 14/4/2013
- searched for "the century dictionary and cyclopedia" or "the century dictionary" at archive.org
- added the first page number of each volume in "first-pages.php"

for each volume, ex volume 4 :
- downloaded all versions/books of volume 4
- ran "extract-first-words.php 4"
- for each 4/*.csv file, removed the first lines down to the first entry
- ran "php compare-first-words.php 4 cu31924091890610_djvu.csv"
  note that the selected book for display passed as a second parameter is optional, default is the select book for accuracy
- opened 4/entries.php, verified the alignement of the first entry accross the books, same for the last entry
- copied and pasted the lines between the first and last entries to the end of index.csv 
- added dictionaries/century/search/properties/url/4 in config.php to point to a page/image
- ran "parse century 1", ignored errors, this is just to create the database, and go to page below for fixing purposes
- fixed entries to check (tie or low accuracy), via dicfro using go to page
- ran "parse century 1", fixed errors
- searched for the word "missing" as in "Missing page" with XML Copy Editor in the cu31924091890628_djvu.xml (volume 5 in this case)
- added a direct link to an exiting page in another version/book for each missing page 

- moved "410  needle" down one line in cu31924091890628_djvu.csv (volume 5) because missing page was overlooked by the scan
